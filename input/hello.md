# Hello, World!

This is what a post generated by `md2blog` looks like. This post is generated from the `input/hello.md` file, written in the [GitHub markdown flavour](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

YAML formatted metadata can also be added to the beginning of the Markdown file in the following format:

```
---
title: Hello, World!
date: 2024-10-13
---
```

If this metadata section does not exist (or is incomplete), `md2blog` will try to figure out the title from the highest-hierarchy heading in the file, and the date from the file's modification timestamp.
